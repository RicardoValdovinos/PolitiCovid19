# PolitiCovid19

## Description

PolotiCovid19 is a small data visualization application that compares the infection rates of a state with its political party affiliation.

It takes CSV datasets for Covid19 gathered from https://covidtracking.com/data/download, https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days, and a csv dataset for the 2020 election results that was manually created by referencing https://www.270towin.com/.

The app will generate a pdf of 4 plots. Two line plots, one for democrat affiliated states and another for republican affiliated states, showing the amount of individuals hospitalized from mid january to late november. One bar plot showing the cases per 100000 individual, color coded by state political affiliation. Blue bars are Democratic while red bars are Republican. Finally, a pie chart with two segments showing the total cases. One segment representing total cases in  Republican states and the other Democratic states.
